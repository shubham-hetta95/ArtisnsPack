                  <br />
                    <br />  These Terms of Use (or “Terms”) govern your use of Artisans Pack, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Artisans Pack Service (the “Service”), outlined below. When you create an Artisans Pack or use Artisans Pack, you agree to these terms. The Artisans Pack Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.

The Artisans Pack Service is one of the Artisans Pack Products, provided to you by Artisans Pack, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Artisans Pack, Inc. 
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Instead of paying to use Artisans Pack, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the  Artisans Pack Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.

We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
